# Cowboy Tutorial Part 2: Creating Flat File Blog

If you follow ElixirDose blog, we did tried to create a very simple web framework [over here](http://elixirdose.com/post/lets-build-a-web-framework). In that article we did serve some markdown file as the example. In this article, we take the markdown example a little bit further by creating a drop dead simple flat file blogging engine. Because the first article is little bit outdated, we will learn together how to get started with [cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy), a small, fast, and modular HTTP server written in Erlang.
